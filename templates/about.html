        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The market for craft beer in the U.S. continues to grow, and consumers' willingness to spend more for variety, flavor and quality has only increased since modern craft brewing began in the 1960s. Craft beers typically feature <b>higher quality ingredients</b>, providing drinkers with a more unique and flavorous experience than mass-produced options. Those reaching for a craft beer are <b>adventurous</b>, and often looking to try something <b>new</b>, certainly with no shortage of choices. The number of independent breweries operating in the U.S. reached an <b>all-time high</b> in 2021, with 9,118 different locations(!!) producing their own brew(s) (<a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/">Brewers Association</a>). For perspective, there were about 13,000 McDonald's locations nationwide that same year (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/256040/mcdonalds-restaurants-in-north-america/">Statista</a>), and there are currently just 3,062 Chipotle locations in the United States (<a href="https://www.scrapehero.com/location-reports/Chipotle-USA/">ScrapeHero</a>). So yeah, people like their beer.</p>
        <br>
